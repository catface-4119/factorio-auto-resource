# Introduction
Fork by catface-4119, if you are the mod author and do not approve of this fork, please contact me.
This fork mainly fixes the "entity marked for destruction but still receiving items"-issue, that was driving me insane.

Original text:
* Collect and distribute resources(including ammo) automatically, just like playing RTS game! 
* If you play sandbox mode, please create character first or it will lead script error. Open console, execute "/c game.player.create_character()"
* Do not support Multiplayer, never tested.
* In Wave Defense the system give you some turret and a rocket-silo at first, these can not be recognized by mod, you need click them open the GUI such the mod can get the event notify.
* Do not support previous save because game don't give a API to read all entities. The script only can get notify event by player building or robot building. If you load a previous save, game will run but the mod will not able to recognize all entities you built, you need rebuild them.
* May not work with some Mod.

# Demo
* Video : TBD
* Screenshot: ![](https://github.com/njikmf/Factorio_auto_resource/blob/master/Capture.PNG)

# How it works
Original text:
* When you build a furnace/chest/machine/... the mod will remember it and collect production, add ingredients preiodicty. Because the lua API don't give such a "production complete" event notify, the script check this every XX ms.
Catface-Edit:
I changed the update timer to check every 10th tick, standard value was every 5th tick.

# Performance
Original text: The entity number will affect the efficiency but I tested it with about 10000 entities it works well, CPU load <10%, 60 FPS stable
Catface-Edit: I changed the fuel amount to 5 and halfed the amount the mod updates per second, because it started to get laggy with a semi-small factory.

# Feature list
* Supported resources: all items needed by all science pack + artillery shell. To avoid waste I set a max value for each type. Check code for details. If the resource reach the limit the script will not collect it from machine, you can still use belt+inserter+chest to collect.

```

* Max fuel: default value is 5, it means if a machine has 1 fuel, script will add 4 fuel; if it has 6 fuel, the script will take 1 fuel away.

* "steam" will not be managed, because different temperature works different(nuclear power)

* Furnace batch mode: Click the FT button to select type and put furnace. If you don't like this select "none"

* Resources exchange: Click the button, follow the tips. Fluid types are not supported. If want give back the resource, put the resource to chest.
